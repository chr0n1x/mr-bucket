Largely taken from [this Vue.js Websocket Tutorial on TutorialEdge.net](https://tutorialedge.net/javascript/vuejs/vuejs-websocket-tutorial/). Except I display the messages on the page, and provide a valid test endpoint (thanks to [Pie Socket](https://www.piesocket.com/websocket-tester)).

This project was mainly done in part because I just needed something to connect to a websocket and then display messages being sent.

## Project setup

yarn install
```

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

## Usage

Enter a Websocket URL that you want to listen to. To test you can just use a URL from [Pie Socket](https://www.piesocket.com/websocket-tester)
